Is it climate change, the loss of biodiversity,chances and risks of new technologies & digitalization, health & food or equality, the understanding of living systems and their interaction with our sourroundings became more and more important. \n\nHence, designing a place that offers an interactive environment and supports creativity & collaboration for actively creating a sustainable future within a bio based society, was our answer. So we upgraded our machBar-Potsdam (fabLab), with open biolab facilities, to cultivate organisms and grow your own biological raw material, design your individual bio-based product and make IT.\n\nOur facilities are embedded into the community of a self-governed sozio-cultural youth center, called freiLand-Potsdam. Here cooperates more than 50 active stakeholder, which mission it is to empower young people to design a sustainable future.\n\n\n\n combining local expertise and global networks in a creative environment \n\n\n\nCommunity\n\nmachbar \n\nWP \n\nFreiland \n\nPotsdam\n\n\n\nStory\n\nopening 13.10.2018\n\nDiReBio\n\nFunded by BMBF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us","link":{"label":"Newsletter","url":"http://eepurl.com/dJvaA6","button":true},"color":"darkBlue"}]},"html":""}},"pageContext":{}}
